      <h1>Battle Tendancy</h1>
      <p>The second part, set in the year 1938, follows Jonathan's grandson Joseph Joestar. He too is trained in Hamon through Hamon master Lisa Lisa, who happens to be his own mother. Joseph comes face-to-face with the creators of the ancient Stone Mask, the Pillar Men, who are much stronger than a typical vampire. He must defeat this ancient race of super-beings with the help of Caesar Anthonio Zeppeli, Lisa Lisa, and Rudol Von Stroheim before they can recover the Red Stone of Aja and become rulers of the world. Battle Tendency ends with Joseph defeating Kars, at the expense of losing his right hand, and ending the story of the Stone Mask for good.</p>

      <h1>Stardust Crusaders</h1>
      <p>The third part, set in 1989, follows Joseph's grandson Jotaro Kujo as he journeys across the globe in 50 days in order to save his mother from a curse. This part introduces the concept of Stands, supernatural abilities that manifest as the form of the user's fighting spirit. Because DIO has been revived, he has unlocked his own Stand, giving everyone in the Joestar family an ability as well due to their psychic connection to Jonathan's body, which DIO now inhabits. The part concludes with the defeat of DIO at the hands of Jotaro and his Stand, Star Platinum, however at the cost of losing several allies on the long journey.</p>
