      <h1>Golden Wind</h1>
      <p>The fifth part, set in 2001 in Italy, follows DIO's son Giorno as he dismantles the Italian mob from the inside. Giorno is blessed with the good fortune and chivalry of a Joestar, technically being a descendant of Jonathan due to DIO inhabiting his body, as well as blessed with a Stand ability. Giorno joins Bruno Bucciarati, Guido Mista, Leone Abbachio, and the other members of Passione, attempting to take down the mob's illusive boss: Diavolo. The plot goes much deeper, as the lore behind the Stand Arrows is revealed, and the secrets that the Arrow's possess are finally brought out. The part ends with Giorno using the arrow to transform his Stand into Gold Experience Requiem, and defeating Diavolo once and for all, taking his place as the leader of Passione.</p>

      <h1>Stone Ocean</h1>
      <p>In Florida in 2011, follows Jotaro Kujo's daughter Jolyne Cujoh after she is sent to prison for a crime she did not commit. While learning about the bizarre rules and prisoners in the Green Dolphin Street Prison, Jolyne discovers the evil plot perpetrated by Enrico Pucci to steal her father's memory, and read the contents of a diary left behind by DIO, which tell of a way to reach "Heaven" and let Pucci be able to change fate. Jolyne is accompanied by Ermes Costello, Emporio Alni√±o, Foo Fighters, Narciso Anasui, and Weather Report, as they attempt to save Jotaro and stop Pucci. The story ends with five of them, including Jotaro, being killed by Pucci, as his plans come to fruition and the universe is reset. He is ultimately defeated by Emporio, which causes the universe to be reset again, creating a new world untouched by Pucci's influence, ending the curse of the Joestar bloodline for good.</p>
